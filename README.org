* Intro
If a command depends on a certain program to be installed on your
system, but it's not, that command is broken. =Whicher= makes it easy
to keep track of the programs that your config depends on.

Example:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq mu4e-get-mail-command (whicher "mbsync -a"))
(setq mu4e-html2text-command (whicher "w3m -T text/html"))
#+end_src

Now, =whicher= knows that your config depends on =mbsync= and =w3m=.

This comes at almost no performance penalty, since =executable-find= isn't called by
=whicher=.

Use =whicher-report= to see the state of your dependencies.  The output is similar to the
output of =which(1)=, hence the name.
